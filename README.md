# Awesome Archive Tools 

Many social media and web platforms allow you to download your content as an
archive. Some platforms have been doing this for a while, but many started doing
it as a result of the European Union's [General Data Protection
Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
(GDPR), specifically [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/), which
requires platforms to make data available to users in a "commonly used
electronic form".

While it's great we can download our own data, it's often made available in a
raw format that isn't terribly useful for most people.

**Awesome Archive Tools** is a list of tools that you can use use to work with
these platform archives. By *platform* we mean any web property that allows you
to download *your* data, and by *tool* we mean anything that lets you work with
the downloaded data. For example, tools that let you scrape from the web or
extract data from APIs are important, but out of scope for this modest list.

Admittedly, part of the rationale for this list is to hope for a day when there
are more tools like this. If you don't see one for the platform archive you have
maybe consider creating one and adding it here?
