# Awesome Archive Tools 

Many social media and web platforms allow you to download your content as an
archive. Some platforms have been doing this for a while, but many started doing
it as a result of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), specifically [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/), which
requires platforms to make data available to users in a "commonly used
electronic form". While it's great we can download our own data, it's often made
available in a raw format that isn't terribly useful for most people.

**Awesome Archive Tools** is a list of tools that you can use use to work with
these platform exports. By platform we mean any web property that allows you to
download your data.
